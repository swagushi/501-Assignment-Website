            The internet has brought a plethora of pros and benefits, but it also brings a large number of cons or risks. One of the risks highlighted in the book "Risks and Security of Internet and Systems" is the vulnerability of systems to online cyber-attacks. With the paper saying that, "Threat Modeling of Cyber-Physical Systems in Practice" by Ameerah-Muhsinah Jamil et al., "Ordinary cybersecurity systems weren’t built with cybersecurity within mind. However, they did operate on Operational Technology networks. Although the internet has a lot of pros that come with, due to the growth of technology the risks only become more prevalent. (Broadhurst, R., Skinner, K., Sifniotis, N., Matamoros-Macias, B., & Ipsen, Y. ,2020).

            <div class="heading_container heading_center">
              <p> Now that these systems are incorporated more with IT networks based on IP, etc., they expose weak points that can be exploited by the attackers through these IT networks." The integration of Cyber-physical systems also known as CPSs with IT networks expands the attack surface, which gives leverage to attackers to potentially control these systems and cause system behavior that could lead to possible issues with safety measures. Also to mention that the authors also try to heavily emphasize the need for any threat modeling methods and techniques to develop secure Cyber-physical systems that can make the internet safer. 

                Another risk highlighted in the book is the security decay of autonomous vehicle systems over time. As shown in the paper "AVSDA: Autonomous Vehicle Security Decay Assessment" by Lama Moukahal et al., "Security practices become weaker over time as attackers' capabilities evolve. Security decay within vehicle software systems can have severe consequences as it can pose a direct threat to people's lives." The authors showed a framework to analyze and predict the security risk level of autonomous vehicle systems throughout their lifespan, showing the identity of security decay and the application of proper mitigation measures. 
                
                These examples from the book show the risks associated with the increasing of Cyber-physical systems and the internet, bringing to light the need for great security measures and continuous monitoring to address evolving threats especially the threats of phishing

                The risks phishing causes
              </span></h2>
              <p>
                It is crucial to recognize that the internet has introduced new and evolving threats, such as phishing attacks, which can lead to risks to companies or enterprises of the sort. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers try to trick individuals into showing sensitive and personal data or information, such as login details or financial details, by pretending to be a person that you can trust. With the big spread and use of email, messaging, and social media being popular in this generation, phishing attacks have become smarter and very difficult to detect. These attacks can lead to data breaches where you lose your data, financial loss, and damage to the reputation or status of enterprises or corporations. That is why it is crucial to understand not only the benefits of the internet, but also the risks that it harbors with great emphasis on the risk that phishing causes. 

Phishing attacks can lead to a big risk to communities, especially in universities. As shown in the study by Broadhurst et al., "International students were significantly more susceptible to email scams than domestic students. Although the nature of this relationship is unclear, it is theorized that international students were possibly disadvantaged by language barriers and or had different experiences with cybercrime in the country they come from."  This finding shows how vulnerable these groups of communities are to phishing scams. Awareness and training programs to the unique needs of separate groups of individuals within a community are important to lessen the impact of the risks that phishing has and strengthen the strength cybersecurity has on the internet.  

All-in-all, it's safe to say that the internet is amazing, but is filled to the brim with phishing scams of every kind, but if you keep the risks in mind it’ll help you traverse the internet a lot safer if those risks in mind plus awareness is always a good thing, even if you rarely surf the internet.
