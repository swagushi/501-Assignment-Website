          We conducted a study on how different industries might respond to phishing attempts. Our main objective was to comprehend why some individuals fall for phishing scams while others do not, based on whether the scam appeals to their personal motives or external factors. After conducting research, we focused on the finance industry, which includes banks, credit unions, investment firms, and insurance companies. This industry is a significant part of the US economy and is often targeted by phishers seeking to steal valuable information or money.

            <p> One way to determine the effectiveness of phishing training is to assess whether it helps employees properly handle genuine emails, not just avoid fake ones. However, this aspect of training has not been very successful so far. In some studies, individuals were so cautious after training that they refrained from clicking on links in real emails, which was unexpected. Furthermore, the emergence of sophisticated language models like ChatGPT has made phishing attacks more challenging, as they are able to replicate human conversations. Nevertheless, we can leverage AI to combat phishing by incorporating AI-based tools into our standard security training.

          <h2> What to do if you've fallen victim </h2>
          <p>
            Contact your financial institution immediately and alert it to the situation.
Suppose you have disclosed sensitive information in a phishing attack. In that case, you should also contact one of the three major credit bureaus and discuss whether you need to place a fraud alert on your file, which will help prevent thieves from opening a new account in your name. Here is the contact information for each bureau's fraud division:

        <div>
        <h4>1.</h4>
        <p> Never provide your personal information in response to an unsolicited request, whether over the phone or the Internet. Emails and Internet pages created by phishers may look exactly like the real thing. They may even have a fake padlock icon that denotes a secure site. You should not provide any information if you did not initiate the communication.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>2.</h4>
        <p> If the contact is legitimate, contact the financial institution yourself. You can find phone numbers and websites on the monthly statements you receive from your financial institution, or you can look up the company in a phone book or on the Internet. The key is that you should be the one to initiate the contact, using contact information that you have verified yourself.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>3.</h4>
        <p> Under no circumstances should you provide your password over the phone or in response to an unsolicited Internet request. A financial institution would never ask you to verify your account information online. Thieves armed with this information and your account number can help themselves to your savings. This is a severe threat to your financial security.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>4.</h4>
        <p> Review account statements regularly to ensure all charges are correct. If your account statement arrives late, it needs to arrive on time. Call your financial institution to find out why. If your financial institution offers electronic account access, periodically review activity online to catch suspicious activity.</p>
