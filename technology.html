              The benefits and risks regarding of internet use in preventing phishing and identity theft 
            </h3>
            <p>
              The prominence in online safety have never been more prominent as the rising numbers of internet use becomes more widespread.

              Though the benefits are numerous its unparalled convenience brings however a host of challenges especially in the realm of identity theft and phishing.

              The internet does offer a selection of resources that aid in the prevention of phishing and identity theft.
               One example can be the many browsers that can be used, such as Google and Microsoft Edge, both use anti-phishing tools that prevent phishing scams and identity theft.
               Furthermore, online websites do offer educational material to assist users in recognizing and avoiding common phishing tactics. Lastly security professionals are starting to use AI in the effort of identifying cyber attackers. 
               However, with major technological advancements, cybercriminals have made it easier to do phishing attacks and identity theft by creating fake websites that look extremely identical to legitimate websites. For example a cyber criminal can create an online banking website that can steal users credit card information email address phone numbers or any other personal information that they have submitted themselves. This has costed internet users over a billion dollars each year.
              Additionally, with the rise of artificial intelligence, it has now started an arms race between criminals to hone in the effectiveness of phishing and other forms of cyber attacks. For example, making emails sound more human. Because of these two reasons and many more
              there has now been a 61% increase in reported phishing scams. The use of AI in both assisting cyber criminals and security professionals raises ethical questions. As both criminals and security professionals use AI to assist them in their goals it showcases that there is neutrality with this technology. This new tech has the power for both malicious and beneficial purposes that support good and bad people. What Safeguards should be in place that can ensure the development of AI can prioritze ethical considerations rather unethical?  
               Though websites and companies are starting to create ways to cease phishing scams and identity theft, it does start to raise some ethical questions such as how personal data is being treated. We selected this topic as numerous victims of phishing and identity theft have risen to the technological advancements of the internet, and its benefits are starting to be outweighed by the advancement of scammers. It is a major issue that will still be relevant for years to come.
