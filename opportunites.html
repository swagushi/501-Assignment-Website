            Phishing is classified as an Internet and cybercrime attack; it is the illegal act of gaining account information through impersonating an entity.  A target or targets are contacted by email, phone, or any messaging platform and disguise themselves as an illegitimate corporation or company. “It involves account names, passwords, and financial accounts (Ramzan 2010; Tan et al. 2020). In APWG’s Phishing Activity Trends Report for the third quarter of 2022 1,270,883 phishing attacks were recorded during the quarter”. Attacks that targeted the financial section led to the highest percentage of all phishing attacks 23.2% (Report 2022).  Phishing consists of communicating with users impersonating an entity to convince them to provide sensitive information or conduct illegal transactions, mostly through identity fraud. This is an ongoing issue with the first attack dated back to 30 years ago, with the oldest known attack being in the 1990’s (Bingxue Fu, Yixuan Wang and Tao Feng, 2024)

              <p> Phishing websites have been evolving in recent years, meaning older URL and HTML based detection methods have been outdated and less effective. This in-turn led to the development of visual similarity-based detection methods. These new methods can accurately identify phishing websites since the main factor of deception of the user is the visual similarity between pishing sites and their counterpart legitimate ones. However, there are flaws with this method of retaliation, they often suffer from high false positive rates. To resolve this problem a study created a new framework, similarity phishing detection. Using a deep learning model the framework looks for a website logo and incorporates the logo area with the full webpage to detect phishing webpages.

              Phishing poses the greatest global cybersecurity threat for individuals and organizations alike. There are numerous types of phishing attacks, each employing sophisticated techniques to deceive victims. 

The most prevalent and intrusive form of phishing involves email. Attackers meticulously craft legitimate-looking messages impersonating trusted entities. They mimic visual elements and branding from reputable companies, making the messages appear harmless and routine. Spear phishing constitutes targeted attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations. These highly personalized campaigns leverage detailed information about the intended victims, increasing the likelihood of success. 

A common spear phishing tactic involves impersonating a high-ranking individual within the target's organization. For instance, a scammer may send an email posing as the victim's boss or executive, then use that to extract private details about the company. Then use that information to manipulate the employee or boss into sending money to the scammer. Smishing: Phishing via SMS text messages can be very dangerous as people may get a message from a scammer impersonating a phone company saying, ‘you have won a month of free data click the link to continue.’ (Daniel Sturman, Elliot A. Bell, Jaime C. Auton, Georgia R. Breakey, Mark W. Wiggins, 2024)

          <p> While I agree with some points in this research I do have some gripes about it, one of them being the reliance of website logos. Yes, this may be a clever idea for the few phishing websites which have a distinct logo. Many phishing websites may not have a distinct logo or may use a slightly different/modified version of the legitimate logo. This may lead to false negatives or may result in additional processing for logo variations. Another issue I have with this is that scanning a full webpage for the logo area using deep learning models can be extremely expensive, specifically for real time detection for clients or for large scale setups. But mainly because scammers/attackers may adapt and develop evasion techniques to counter the created framework, such as using dynamic visuals (by constantly changing the visual elements or the loading content) the framework will have a tough time keeping up with the changes.  

            (Daniel Sturman, Elliot A. Bell, Jaime C. Auton, Georgia R. Breakey, Mark W. Wiggins, 2024) 
            
            
            
            
            
            A study was opened to investigate the role of phishing knowledge. 145 participants completed an online email sorting task where they had to identify if the email was legitimate or phishing attempts. The study measured many factors that could influence the participants' ability to tell if it was legitimate or not. Knowledge of phishing, they tested how much the participant already knew about phishing, if the participant made the decision rationally or instinctively after reading the email. If the participant noticed the cues that the email was illegitimate e.g., if there was no subject line or sketch URL. Cue utilization was the only factor that helped differentiate the genuine emails from the phishing ones. Phishing knowledge was linked directly to phishing detection in emails. This proves that by increasing the dangers of phishing individuals start to develop safer online behavioral patterns, “anti-phishing training needs to provide opportunities for trainees to develop meaningful cue associations.”  (Daniel Sturman, Elliot A. Bell, Jaime C. Auton, Georgia R. Breakey, Mark W. Wiggins, 2024) </p>
